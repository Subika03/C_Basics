Daily C Programming Practice
Welcome to my C programming practice repository! This project is dedicated to learning and mastering the basics of the C programming language through daily exercises and programs.

Purpose
The primary goal of this repository is to build a strong foundation in C programming by consistently practicing essential concepts. Each program is focused on learning and improving fundamental skills.

Topics Covered
Here are the basic topics I am focusing on:

Input and Output: printf, scanf
Data Types and Variables: int, float, char, etc.
Operators: Arithmetic, relational, logical, and bitwise operators
Control Structures:
Conditional statements (if, else, switch)
Loops (for, while, do-while)

Future Goals
As I become more comfortable with the basics, I aim to explore:

Advanced concepts like dynamic memory allocation
Data structures in C (linked lists, stacks, queues)
Working with libraries and modules
Building small projects or games
